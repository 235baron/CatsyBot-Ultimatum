# CatsyBot-Ultimatum
The Ultimate, Updated, Usurping CatsyBot

# The answer to life
So... lemme start with the weird advertisement.

This Bot happens to be one of the answers to life (after 42)!
It just happens to be so that this Bot can cure Cancer‚ÇÅ and help with the healing of bones‚ÇÅ!
Just click the button with a / on it and select on of the bountiful options which show up in the slash menu!
Let's just add exclamation marks to make this seem more amazing!!
Yes!!

# Back to the Real stuff
Basically, this bot is meant to have a successful multi system (meaning that it has, let's say, a minigame category and an admin category together). The Economy system
is specially tailored to be the buggiest system on the planet (after CyberPunk 2077) but has some neat features and ways to get rich fast‚ÇÇ. This Bot works with PyCord
(PyCord haters pls dont raid me / Best fork of discord.py) and has nearly all commands in slash. The admin commands are not but that is intentionally done to hide the
dangerous perms from normal guys in the slash menu. Then there's also a simple category for simple information, server's member amount, bot support server invite etc.
